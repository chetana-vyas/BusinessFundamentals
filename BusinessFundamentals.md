# Project Proposal

## Movie Recommendation System


## Purpose:
This is the age of OTT. Streaming is the new way of consumption. 
We want to build a model to provide our members with personalized suggestions to reduce the amount of time and frustration to find something great content to watch.

## Goal:
Increase the subscribers to OTT platform / decrease customer churn rate


## Data Description:

Using web scraping to get the movie dataset from public websites:

•  [data-world-movie-dataset dataset](https://data.world/promptcloud/imdb-data-from-2006-to-2016)

• [grouplens movie dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## Algorithms:

Build the recommendation model using KNN ( K - Nearest Neighbor ) to find movie clusters based on - IMDB Movie rating, genres, actors, populatity, etc.

## Tools:

Google spreadsheets - initial Exploratory Data Analysis
Tableau - interactive dashboards
Python packages for building the model –
	1.	Scikit-learn – build Linear Regression model
	2.	Pandas – manipulating and working on data frames
	3.	NumPy – working with arrays
	4.	matplotlib and seaborn – data visualization


## MVP Goal:
For any given input movie (movie an individual has watched), the model finds top 10 movies based on which this individual will be interested in.
